# Intro
intro: Custom software for small and large businesses and individuals

# Areas
areas_summary: We design and develop software in the following areas
mobile_apps: Mobile applications
mobile_apps_desc: >
  Targeting the Android and iOS platforms, we develop native mobile applications for specific needs. This may include
  the development of any backend that is necessary but may also include integration with existing backend systems. We
  can create the user interface and interaction designs in accordance with the UI guidelines specific to the platform.
web_apps: Web applications
web_apps_desc: >
  We create web applications using the latest standards and modern web frameworks. All our web solutions are optimized
  for mobile devices. If no backend system is readily available then we can develop the entire stack from frontend to
  backend (full stack).
db_dev: Database development
db_dev_desc: >
  We develop purely database-oriented software too for various database solutions, including relational and NoSQL solutions
  (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, mongoDB, ...). This includes the development of data transformation jobs,
  Extract-Transfer-Load (ETL) processes, data warehouses and analytics.
cloud: Cloud and microservices
cloud_desc: >
  We develop software to run on the cloud in the form of microservices, if need be. Any server-side software we build is
  shipped in a containerized form (via Docker) which enables installation to most cloud infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud, ...)
  as well as on-premise systems.
reveng: Reverse engineering
reveng_desc: >
  Should you have any existing systems that you would like to modify or replace, we can assist you. The need for reverse
  engineering activity arises when legacy, undocumented systems are still in use. We conduct a thorough analysis on such
  systems before making the requested changes or doing any other alterations.
support: Support and consulting
support_desc: >
  All the software we build can be extended with a support agreement tailored to the project. We can also take over the
  operational aspect and deliver in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) form. We can assist you as well if you are in need of
  professional counsel before making decisions concerning the software you use.

# Process
process_summary: This is how working with us looks like
process_step1: >
  Contact us via mail or conveniently using the offer request form and we'll get back to you soon to organize a meeting.
  There we can start becoming familiar with your story and the software you have in mind.
process_step2: >
  Together we discuss the details and scheduling of the project, what kind of software you need, how would you like it to be
  delivered, etc.. We also start creating a draft and discuss the next steps.
process_step3: >
  The software is developed iteratively using an agile methodology. We regularly ship new increments so you can see how
  development progresses and adjust it constantly to your exact needs. Documentation and testing is done repeatedly in this
  phase.
process_step4: >
  We regularly check the done criteria we established at the beginning and make sure the software meets the requirements
  and the quality expectations.
process_step5: >
  When the first production-grade version of the software is ready, we install it to the infrastructure of your choice or place it
  in an application store in case of mobile apps. This is where the development phase finishes and the operation phase begins according
  to the support agreements made.
